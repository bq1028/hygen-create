# BACKLOG
a list of features that would be cool to add to `hygen-create`

* If there's an existing generator: `hygen-create status` should show which files have changed in relation to the existing generator.
* support symlinks
* keep filemodes (chmod)
* follow .gitignore rules when adding complete directories
* `hygen-create rm <dir>` should remove everything under <dir>
* `hygen-create status -R` should recursively show whether files are included or not
